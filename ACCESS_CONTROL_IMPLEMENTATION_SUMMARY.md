## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Centralized Configuration**: Single source of truth for all access rules
2. **Server-Side Enforcement**: All security enforced on the server
3. **Layered Security**: Multiple layers of access control (API, UI, data)
4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Deny access by default, explicit grants required
5. **Role-Based Design**: Clear separation of concerns by user role

### Security Features

1. **Session Validation**: All requests validate user authentication
2. **Role Verification**: Every action checks user role permissions
3. **Data Isolation**: Proper filtering prevents data leakage
4. **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged for security monitoring
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Queries**: Database queries optimized for role-based filtering
2. **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight access control checks
3. **Caching Strategy**: Access control decisions cached where appropriate
4. **Scalable Design**: System designed to scale with user growth

## Compliance and Security
