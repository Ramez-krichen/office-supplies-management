## General Introduction

The technological revolution has profoundly changed our society and our way of life. It opens new perspectives and offers numerous opportunities to improve our daily lives, particularly in the office supplies management sector which is a dynamic and evolving domain, where digital tools have transformed the way of managing stocks, processing requests, and optimizing supply processes.

Currently, the concept of online office supplies management platforms already exists. There are many solutions that allow managing stocks and orders. The difficulties that companies face are the lack of an integrated platform for complete office supplies management, including request management, hierarchical approval, order tracking, and supplier management.

In this context, we are called during this end-of-study project to design and develop a complete computer system for office supplies management, in order to address the identified gaps. This application will allow user management with different roles, creation and approval of requests, management of orders and suppliers, as well as generation of detailed reports.

This report will detail the different phases to create the office supplies management system. For this, this report will be composed of six chapters organized as follows:

The first chapter entitled "Preliminary Study" presents the host organization, puts the subject in its general context, the general project, the tasks to be performed, and the functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

The second chapter entitled "Analysis and Specification" presents the architecture and technologies used. It also exposes the product backlog to decompose the project into a set of sprints. Finally, it is concluded by planning following the Scrum methodology.

The third chapter entitled "Authentication and User Management" explains the authentication principle with NextAuth and is dedicated to sprint 1.

The fourth chapter entitled "Request Management and Purchase Orders" is dedicated to the development of sprint 2.

The fifth chapter entitled "Supplier Management and Inventory" is dedicated to the development of sprint 3.

The sixth chapter entitled "Reports and Statistics" is dedicated to the development of sprint 4.

Finally, a conclusion that summarizes this work while opening perspectives for future developments.

## Chapter 2: Analysis and Specification

### Introduction

In this chapter, we start by presenting the technologies used. Subsequently, we will define the architecture of this project. Then, we will explain the Agile method and Scrum, before creating the product backlog and planning the sprints.

### Technologies Used

| Icon | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Next.js** | Next.js is a React framework for production that allows creating fast and optimized web applications with server-side rendering and static site generation. |
| **React** | React is a JavaScript library for creating interactive and reactive user interfaces, developed by Facebook. |
| **TypeScript** | TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to pure JavaScript, offering better type safety and improved development tools. |
| **Prisma** | Prisma is a modern ORM for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database access with a type-safe client and automatic migrations. |
| **NextAuth.js** | NextAuth.js is a complete authentication solution for Next.js that supports many authentication providers and security strategies. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows rapidly creating custom user interfaces without writing custom CSS. |
| **PostgreSQL** | PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system, known for its reliability and extended features. |
| **Vercel** | Vercel is a cloud deployment platform optimized for frontend applications and serverless functions. |

### Architecture Used

#### Next.js Architecture Definition

Next.js uses a modern architecture based on React with advanced features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. This architecture allows creating performant and SEO-friendly web applications.

The advantages of Next.js are:
- **Hybrid rendering**: Combination of SSR, SSG, and CSR according to needs
- **Automatic optimization**: Code splitting, image optimization, etc.
- **API Routes**: Integrated backend for creating APIs
- **Performance**: Automatic optimizations for speed
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, etc.

#### General Architecture of this Application

Our application follows a layered architecture with the following components:

1. **Presentation Layer** (Frontend: Next.js + React)
2. **API Layer** (Next.js API Routes)
3. **Authentication Layer** (NextAuth.js)
4. **Business Layer** (Services and application logic)
5. **Data Layer** (Prisma + PostgreSQL)

### Work Methodology

#### Agile Method

Agile methods are dedicated to IT project management. They are based on iterative and adaptive development cycles according to the evolving needs of the client. They notably allow involving all collaborators as well as the client in project development.

#### Scrum

Scrum is an agile development method oriented towards IT projects whose resources are regularly updated. It favors rapid delivery of an operational prototype to have rapid feedback from clients.

#### Product Backlog

| Priority | User Story | Complexity |
|----------|------------|------------|
| 1 | As a user, I can authenticate | Medium |
| 2 | As an employee, I can create a supply request | High |
| 3 | As a manager, I can approve/reject requests | Medium |
| 4 | As an admin, I can manage users | High |
| 5 | As an admin, I can manage suppliers | Medium |
| 6 | As an admin, I can manage inventory | High |
| 7 | As a user, I can view reports | Medium |
| 8 | As an admin, I can configure the system | High |

#### Sprint Planning

| Sprint | User Story | Priority | Start Date | End Date |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Sprint 1**: Authentication and user management | - Authentication<br>- Role management<br>- User profiles | 1 | 01/03/2025 | 15/03/2025 |
| **Sprint 2**: Request management and orders | - Request creation<br>- Approval workflow<br>- Order management | 2 | 16/03/2025 | 30/03/2025 |
| **Sprint 3**: Supplier management and inventory | - Supplier management<br>- Stock management<br>- Categorization | 3 | 01/04/2025 | 15/04/2025 |
| **Sprint 4**: Reports and statistics | - Report generation<br>- Dashboards<br>- Analytics | 4 | 16/04/2025 | 30/04/2025 |

### Conclusion

This chapter presents the project foundation by introducing the technologies used, the chosen architecture, and the development methodology.

The use of Next.js with TypeScript will guarantee a modern, secure, and scalable system thanks to React, Prisma, and NextAuth.js. The layered architecture will ensure clear separation of responsibilities and facilitated maintenance.

Furthermore, this chapter also shows the product backlog and sprint planning steps according to the Scrum methodology.
